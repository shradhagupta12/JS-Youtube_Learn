# Magic of Protoype

### Example
``` javascript
const newHero = ['hulk' , 'spiderman'];
```
When we call 'newHero' in window console it return some values the position of the array value , length and 'Prototype'.

We are going to study about the 'Prototype' what it is

"Javascript default behaviour is prototyply behaviour."

In prototype has alot method in it. Which can be used to play with the variable and get your work done.
OK! Lets see an study an amazing think about Javascript. As we seen before that the Javascript is a prototyply. And it inherits at a level to find the soultion for the code till the time it doesn't get a null.

A 'Array' is a Object
A 'String' is a Object
Even a function is Object as well as a Function

In short we can say at the end of the day all the things in JS is a Object.
